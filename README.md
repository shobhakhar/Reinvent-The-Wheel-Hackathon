# Reinvent-The-Wheel-Hackathon

# Challenge1: 
When a customer visits a tire shop for tire replacement, the tires removed (known as scrap tires) 
must be disposed of. ATD is exploring the logistics of scrap tire recycling â€“ acquiring and delivering 
them to downstream recyclers. To effectively do this, ATD needs to know the future demand for
scrap tires at their warehouses on any given day. Predicting this volume is the goal of the first 
challenge. We are challenging you to build a model that will forecast the number of scrap tires in 
each size that a DC can expect to receive from its customers daily, one to seven days out.

# Challenge2:
Challenge #1 we forecasted the number of tires we expect to be at each DC. In this challenge 
we would like to determine the best method to move these tires from the DCs to the recycler for 
a single day, such that we minimize the amount of emitted greenhouse gas (GHG).
